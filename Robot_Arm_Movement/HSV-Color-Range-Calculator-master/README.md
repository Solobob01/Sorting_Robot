# HSV-Color-Range-Calculator
## Description:
  OpenCV python code that enables user to calculate lower and upper range of a color. It can be used to create a mask for color segmentation.
  
## Application:
  Often in image segmentaion using color spaces, we use HSV color space to create the masks for different colors. For this purpose we need to define lower and upper hsv value range for the color of our choice. This python program can be used to calculate hsv color ranges for each color by varying the slider and seeing the result live.

## Example Usage:
  Hold the color object of your choice in front of the webcam and vary the slider values to get a clear mask for the color of our choice.
